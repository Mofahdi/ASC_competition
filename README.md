# American Society for Composites (ASC) 2021 competition
My team from the University of South Carolina won the second place in that competition as can be seen from this [link](https://www.asc-composites.org/student-simulation-competition)<br />
I decided to share my codes I used in the competition along with the presentation and data. I hope you can benefit from it! <br />please feel free to reach out at any time at <code>malfahdi@email.sc.edu</code>
