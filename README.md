# American Society for Composites (ASC) 2021 competition
My team from the University of South Carolina won the second place in that competition as can be seen from this [link](https://www.asc-composites.org/student-simulation-competition).<br />
I decided to share the codes I used for the competition along with the presentation and provided data by the competition, and I hope you can benefit from them! <br />
please feel free to reach out to me for questions at any time at
